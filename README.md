### ArtCatalogue App

SwiftUI app with Widget.<br/>
Access data through The Art Institute of Chicago API. Networking Layer is generated with the use of OpenApi code gen.<br/>
SOA<br/>
Combine, SwiftUI, Realm, OpenAPI.<br/>

### Notepad App

It's a convenient yet stylish and responsive note taking tool.<br/>
The idea is to use notepad in poster design style, i.e. to limit userâ€™s choice for styling the text blocks with the predefined styles.<br/>
Our team is consist of three people: UI/UX designer, product manager and myself as a developer.<br/>
Almost every UI element in the app is customized: it includes transition animations, button actions animations, blurs.<br/>
Please have a look at the demo!<br/>

### [Warehouse App](https://github.com/K-Khud/JuniorTestAssignment)
I've used a test asignment for web-developers to build a mobile app, that displays information about the products and availability.<br/>
All cool features are implemented: JSON parsing, error handling, local cache with the Core Data, SwiftUI together with UIKit, and searching the product by it's name.<br/>
This project illustrates the case of SwiftUI interfacing UIKit, which I personally find very interesting.<br/>

### [Marvel Heroes App](https://github.com/K-Khud/Marvel)
Another project where I was flexing my muscles in working with REST-ful APIs and building UI programmaticaly.<br/>
It's a catalogue of heroes, comics and creators that is received from Marvel's API.
