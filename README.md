### Hi, I'm Katia.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an MVP of a Notepad App. It's a convenient yet stylish and responsive note taking tool. The idea is to use notepad in poster design style, i.e. to limit userâ€™s choice for styling the text blocks with the predefined styles. Our team is consist of three people: UI designer, product manager and myself as a developer. Almost every UI element in the app is customized in terms of performance and behaviour: it includes transition animations, button actions animations, blurs etc.
