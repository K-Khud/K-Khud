### Notepad App

My favorite project is the one I’m currently working on.<br/>
It's a convenient yet stylish and responsive note taking tool.<br/>
The idea is to use notepad in poster design style, i.e. to limit user’s choice for styling the text blocks with the predefined styles.<br/>
Our team is consist of three people: UI designer, product manager and myself as a developer.<br/>
Almost every UI element in the app is customized in terms of performance and behaviour: it includes transition animations, button actions animations, blurs.<br/>
Have a look at the demo!<br/>

### [Warehouse App](https://github.com/K-Khud/JuniorTestAssignment)
I've used a test asignment for web-developers to build a mobile app, that displays information about the products and availability.<br/>
All cool features are implemented: JSON parsing, error handling, local cache with the Core Data, and searching the product by it's name.<br/>
